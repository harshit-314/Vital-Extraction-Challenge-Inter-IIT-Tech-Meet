# Vital-Extraction-Challenge-Inter-IIT-Tech-Meet

Part of a team that represented IIT Hyderabad at the Inter-IIT Tech Meet held at IIT Kanpur in February 2023.

Problem Statement: 

Extract Heart Rate, SpO2, RR, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diabolic Blood Pressure, and MAP from the provided images of Patient Monitoring Systems.

Datasets: 

Monitor Segmentation Dataset - A dataset containing the segmentation boundaries
for the monitors in the image, a total of 2000 images. 

Classification Dataset - The monitors present in the images can be grouped into 4
types, based on some screen characteristics. This is a separate dataset with the
monitors classified into those 4 separate types, a total of 250 images per class,
accounting for 1000 images.

Unlabelled Dataset - A total of 7000 unlabelled images.
